Day 1

What I did
-Implemented background and map size on canvas
-Implemented basic camera controls for arrows and mouse
-Implemented a single marine unit
-Created a marine group with basic collisions with itself

-Experimented with unit selection and right click movement
-Played around with mutli group selection

Problems I encountered 
-Phaser's limiations on mouse controls and interactions
-Mutliple selection on groups not working with intended solution
-How to strucutre code: do I need a Marine Model?

What I plan to accomplish today
-Judgement Call: Do I restructure my specs to fit the technology in the framework?
			
				 Do I try to implemented a custom solution to satisfy specs?
