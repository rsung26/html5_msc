Day 1

What I did
-Implemented background and map size on canvas
-Implemented basic camera controls for arrows and mouse
-Implemented a single marine unit
-Created a marine group with basic collisions with itself

-Experimented with unit selection and right click movement
-Played around with mutli group selection

Problems I encountered 
-Phaser's limiations on mouse controls and interactions
-Mutliple selection on groups not working with intended solution
-How to strucutre code: do I need a Marine Model?

What I plan to accomplish today
-Judgement Call: Do I restructure my specs to fit the technology in the framework?
			
				 Do I try to implemented a custom solution to satisfy specs?



Day 2

What I did
-Code Refactor for Marines
-Researched on using Fabric.js to implement drag selection
-implemented Banelings and Explosions group
-Worked on basic collisions/interactions between banelings and marines

Problems
-The judgement call on the important of drag selection 
-Directing banelings to move intelligently


Day 3 

What I did today
-Worked on displaying Game Status Text to Canvas
-Implemented Time Warp Feature
-Created skeleton for a reset and round advance feature
-Drew out diagrams/algorithms for game

Problems
-Give a Delay Time of 5-10 seconds between rounds
-Banelings not overlap each other but still move towards the center
-Multiple Drag Select
-Successfully resetting values on a round reset

Day 4

What I want to do today

-Implement code to mechanically restart/advance a round
	-Control Flow between winning and losing a round
	-First Implement a restart without winning round



-Inclulde 5 second delay between rounds(countdown timer is a plus)

-Include extra banelings per round to make the game harder
-Reimplement how banelings move to a more spread out formation
-Have banelings come from one of the four random corners of map

-Consider working on Attack Range
-Consider working on Drag Selecting

Bugs:
Using Time Warp after banelings have passed marines will make them move in the reverse direction
Score does not compute correctly
