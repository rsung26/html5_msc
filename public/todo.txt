Day 1

What I did
-Implemented background and map size on canvas
-Implemented basic camera controls for arrows and mouse
-Implemented a single marine unit
-Created a marine group with basic collisions with itself

-Experimented with unit selection and right click movement
-Played around with mutli group selection

Problems I encountered 
-Phaser's limiations on mouse controls and interactions
-Mutliple selection on groups not working with intended solution
-How to strucutre code: do I need a Marine Model?

What I plan to accomplish today
-Judgement Call: Do I restructure my specs to fit the technology in the framework?
			
				 Do I try to implemented a custom solution to satisfy specs?



Day 2

What I did
-Code Refactor for Marines
-Researched on using Fabric.js to implement drag selection
-implemented Banelings and Explosions group
-Worked on basic collisions/interactions between banelings and marines

Problems
-The judgement call on the important of drag selection 
-Directing banelings to move intelligently


Day 3 

What I did today
-Worked on displaying Game Status Text to Canvas
-Implemented Time Warp Feature
-Created skeleton for a reset and round advance feature
-Drew out diagrams/algorithms for game

Problems
-Give a Delay Time of 5-10 seconds between rounds
-Banelings not overlap each other but still move towards the center
-Multiple Drag Select
-Successfully resetting values on a round reset

Day 4

-Got stuck on dealing with round restart bug



Day 6

What I did
-Experimented with Drag Selection/Right Click Move
-Experimented on Attack Range

-Readjusted project goals into a more realistic product given time constraints
-Banelings now appear randomly from border of the map
-Implemented forcefields mechanic

Bugs:
Game crashes sometimes when multiple explosions happen
Background does not render on Firefox and Safari


Day 7

-Gathered user feedback through playtesting

-Resolve background bug on different browsers
-Resolve performance issues in Firefox



-Change forcefields to a blue bubble image
-Add a screen blur/flicker when Time Warp is used

-Edit content on pages and add more CSS stylings/animations

-Add Link to Portfolio Site
-Write the README


Extra
-Add Timewarp/Forcefield button for mobile
-Consider adding a fullscreen mode
-Users and High Scores Database



Feedback

Site Changes
-Add an Intro page which explains the rules x
-Users and High Scores

Cosmetic Changes
-Give Forcefields a blue circle image x
-Screen wide Time Warp effect x


Balance Changes 
-Deadzones at the top/bottom middle make the game too easy x
	-Randomize baneling destination
	-Have marines not revive, and increase num exponentially based on that

-Opinions: Time warp a temporary effect? Forcefields a crutch? Baneling Speed too fast?
-More powerups, game modes
Bug: Game over sometimes still happens when one unit left
